    "text": "Analysis\nWe excluded participants manually if they reported data on less than two training sessions, if they did not participate in a structured training programme, or if they were neither runners nor triathletes. The baseline kilometer variable were standardized within their respective sport group, that is, running vs. triathlon. 17 of data were missings. Since most of the incomplete date was due to training sessions that were not completed, we decided against multiple imputation, following the reccomendations of [Lit]. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables - descriptive statistics - correlation\nFor the hierarchical linear models,the time-varying predictors pride and positive affect were group-mean centered, and the stable predictors attribution style (globality, dynamics, locus) and implicit motives (achievement, affiliation, power) were grand mean centered. This procedure entangles the between-person-effects from the within-person-effects. This is in line with recommendations of Wang and Maxwell (2015). They authors emphasize that a within-person effect can be present regardless of the between-person-effect, and vice versa. To illustrate this, it is possible that within a person, a lack of pride after a run predicts the running distance in the next running session. At the same time, people who less proud on average do not necessarily run more. ## Participants\nThe participants were 35.85 old on average (SD = 12.89) ranging from 20 to 60 years"
