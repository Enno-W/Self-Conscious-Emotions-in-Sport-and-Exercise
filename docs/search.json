A sample size calculation using G*Power29 for testing one-sided point biserial correlation with |ρ| = .5, α = .05, and 1 – β = .95 indicated a necessary sample size of N = 34. As an incentive, participants were offered feedback on their results and suggestions for improving their workout routine motivation. N = 41 participants completed the survey. After excluding participants that did not follow a training routine (N = 9), the sample consisted of N = 32 recreational athletes (mean age = 34.69 years, SD = 14), including 19 females, 8 males, and 2 identifying as diverse. Participants followed individual workout routines averaging 6.79 hours per week (SD = 4.04) with a self-rated intensity (perceived exertion) of 5.41 (SD = 1.74). The sports they engaged in included running (n = 10), triathlon (n = 6), weight training (n = 5), and other endurance sports (n = 11). 17 % of data were missing."

We then calculated the speed from the time and distance values for each session, and found a great variability. The speed in a session ranged from 1 to 33 kilometers per hour. As a consequence, we separated the data into three categories that fit with common speed of swimming, running, and cycling. If the speed was less than five kilometers per hour, the session was regarded as “swimming”, less than 20 kilometers per hour as “running”, and more than 20 kilometers per hour as “cycling”. We then z-standardised the session distance within these groups. After this, running distance was normally distributed (p 0.05) Second, descriptive statistics were calculated. Third, according to the small sample size and normally distributed variables, Spearman rank correlations were calculated. For the analysis, the programming language R (R Core Team, 2024) was used."

The sample represents medium authentic pride and medium positive affect, low hubristic pride and low negative affect. Additionally, the sample shows a slightly stronger implicit affiliation motive but regular motive components in all 3 implicit motives. Further, the sample applies more internal, variable, and less uncontrollable attribution styles. Figure 2 visualises the distibution of these variables.\nCorrelations are presented in Table 2 and shown in Figure 1.\nExploratory analyses revealed significant correlations between pride and positive affect (Ρ = 0.5, p &lt; .01), weekly training duration and training distance (Ρ = 0.71, p &lt; .001), the implicit achievement and affiliation motives (Ρ = 0.49, p &lt; .01), hope for success and hope for belonging (Ρ = 0.5, p &lt; .01), hope for success and hope for control (Ρ = 0.59, p &lt; .01), fear of failure and fear of social rejection (Ρ = 0.59, p &lt; .01), fear of failure and fear of loss of control (Ρ = 0.52, p &lt; .01), fear of social rejection and negative affect (Ρ = 0.56, p &lt; .01), and uncontrollable and internal attributions (Ρ = -0.75, p &lt; .001)."

    "text": "Analysis\nWe excluded participants manually if they reported data on less than two training sessions, if they did not participate in a structured training programme, or if they were neither runners nor triathletes. Subsequent analyses were performed using the R language (R Core Team, 2024). 17 of data were missings. Since most of the incomplete date was due to dropouts, we decided against multiple imputation, following the reccomendations of [Lit]. Since the questionnaires were sent out in weekly intervals, we expected autocorrelation between measurement points. Through inspecting variograms, we assessed the correlation structure between measurement points. The results suggested that autoregressive noise was present: The semivariance changed substantially with distance between observations. Thus, we included an autocorrelation structure of order 1 (AR1) in the models.\nTime was not included as predictor, since we did not expect a trend over time. The time-varying predictors pride and positive affect were group-mean centered, and the stable predictors attribution style (globality, dynamics, locus) and implicit motives (achievement, affiliation, power) were grand mean centered. This disentangles the between-person-effects from the within-person-effects, in line with recommendations of Wang and Maxwell (2015): The authors emphasize that a within-person effect can be present regardless of the between-person-effect, and vice versa. To illustrate this, it is possible that within a person, less pride after a run predicts a greater running distance in the next session. At the same time, people who are less proud on average do not necessarily run more. Lastly, we z-standardised all predictors for easier interpretation.\nThe results for the hierarchical linear models are presented separately for each the dependent variables of this study: Session distance, session duration and rate of perceived exhaustion. We used interaction terms of pride with positive affect, causal attribution and implicit motives to predict these dependent variables. The predictors were added in three steps: First, the interaction term of pride and positive affect, second, the interaction terms of pride and attribution styles, and third, interaction terms of pride and implicit motives. We then decided on the appropriate model based on fit indices and explanatory power, and then examined the model quality, checking for normal distribution of residuals, homoscedasticity (constant variance of residuals), absence of multicollinearity, linearity and outliers. We also assessed if a correlation matrix improved the model fit."

The running distance was z-standardized to allow a comparison between the kilometer values reported by swimmers, runners, and triathletes. We added predictors to the null model in three steps: First, the interaction term of pride and positive affect, second, the interaction terms of pride and attribution styles, and third, interaction terms of pride and implicit motives. The result is shown in Table 3.\nThe intraclass correlation coefficient was ICC = 0.25. Model 3 included meaningful predictors and the lowest log-likelihood, it also fit significantly better than the same model without a correlation matrix p &lt; .001. Thus, Model 3 was selected for further analysis of statistical assumptions and the discussion.\nThe residuals were normally distributed (p = 0.095 ). Figure 3 shows a QQ-plot and scatterplot of the residuals. Here, the residuals are concentrated in the left, indicating a slight deviation from the assumption of homoscedasticity.\nThe variance influence factor ranged from vifmin = 1.38 to vifmax = 4.61.\nLinearity was assessed by plotting each predictor against the outcome variable and examining LOESS-smoothed lines for deviations from linear trends. Figure 4 shows substantial deviations from linearity. Figure 5 shows the distribution of outliers in the residuals according to each individual.\nThe marginal and conditional R-squared values, representing the portion of variance explained by the fixed effects and the random effects respectively, were R2marginal = 0.25 and R2conditional = 0.663.\nOn the individual level (level 2), the residuals were not normally distributed (p 0.017). No deviation from the assumption of homoscedasticity was present (p 0.252).\nSeveral interaction terms emerged as significant predictors: The interactions between pride and positive affect (b = 0.393, p = 0.393), and achievement motive (b = 0.583, p = 0.583) were positive, meaning that the effect of pride on the training distance in the next session is stronger when there is a high achievement motive or a high positive affect (in the previous session). The interaction terms between pride and globality (b = 0.393, p = 0.393), the affiliation motive (b = -0.721, p = &lt; .001) and the power motive (b = -0.807, p &lt; .001) were negative: When globality, affiliation or power are high, pride reduces the running distance in the next session."

    "text": "Session Rate of Perceived Exhaustion\nThe regression coefficients are shown in Table 5. The third model with all predictors shows the lowest AIC and log likelihood. A correlation matrix did not result in a better fit ( p 0.84), so we used the model without the correlation structure. It shows the lowest AIC and log likelihood and was tested for statistical assumptions and model quality.\nA more stable attribution style predicted a lower RPE, and so did the interaction terms of pride with positive affect, pride with a more external locus of control, pride with a higher implicit affiliation as well as a higher power motive. Only the interaction between pride and the implicit achievement motive predicted a higher rate of perceived exhaustion for each session.\nThe residuals were normally distributed in a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (p = 0.143 ), but not in a Shapiro-Wilk-test (p &lt; .05). Figure 9 shows the deviation from the normal distribution in a QQ-Plot along with the distribution of residuals. The linear patterns that emerge in the residuals are a result of the discrete values in the session RPE data.\nThe variance influence factor was between vifmin = 1.09 and vifmax = 2.72.\nThe marginal and conditional R-squared values, representing the portion of variance explained by the fixed effects and the random effects respectively, were R2marginal = 0.32 and R2conditional = 0.53.\nFigure 10 shows the predictors plotted against the target variable.\nOn the individual level (level 2), the residuals were not normally distributed (p 0.017). No deviation from the assumption of homoscedasticity was present (p 0.252).\nSeveral interaction terms emerged as significant predictors: When a person had a tendency to more stable attributions, session RPE was reduced (b = -0.462, p &lt; .05). Pride predicted the session rate of perceived exhaustion negatively if positive affect in the last session was high (b = -0.183, p &lt; .01), if people had a more external attribution style (b = -0.317, p &lt; .01), and if the affiliation motive (b = -0.521, p = &lt; .001) or power motive (b = -0.352, p &lt; .001) were high. If the achivement motive was high, higher pride also predicted a higher RPE (b = 0.406, p = 0.406)."
